I'll help you check if the asset files are displaying properly in your quiz app, particularly for the dogs quiz. Let me first examine the quiz data and then check how images are being loaded. Now let me check the ImageProvider service to see how assets are being loaded: Now let me check the actual asset catalog structure to see if the dog images are properly configured: Let me check if the image files actually exist: Let me check the other dog types as well: I notice there's an issue! The collie asset is configured as a `.dataset` instead of a `.imageset`. Let me check its Contents.json: Now let me check if there are missing dog types. Let me see the full `quiz_dogs.json` to see what images are expected: Let me check what dog asset folders exist: Now let me check if there are question and option image assets: Let me also check the cover image: Let me check where the quiz is actually used to see if there are any error messages: Based on my analysis, I've identified several issues with your asset files that could prevent images from displaying properly in the `quiz_dogs.json`:

## Issues Found:

### 1. **Missing Dog Type Images**
The quiz references 6 dog types but you only have assets for 4:
- ✅ **Present**: labrador, shiba, bulldog, collie  
- ❌ **Missing**: greyhound, poodle

### 2. **Incorrect Asset Type for Collie**
The collie image is set up as a `.dataset` instead of `.imageset`:
- Current: `Assets.xcassets/dogs/types/collie.dataset/`
- Should be: `Assets.xcassets/dogs/types/collie.imageset/`

### 3. **Incorrect Asset Type for Cover Image**
The cover image is also a `.dataset` instead of `.imageset`:
- Current: `Assets.xcassets/dogs/cover.dataset/`  
- Should be: `Assets.xcassets/dogs/cover.imageset/`

### 4. **Missing Question and Option Images**
The quiz references several question and option images that don't exist:
- `assets/dogs/questions/q1.jpg`
- `assets/dogs/questions/q5.jpg` 
- `assets/dogs/options/q1_a.jpg`
- `assets/dogs/options/q1_b.jpg`
- `assets/dogs/options/q5_b.jpg`

## Solutions:

1. **Add missing dog type assets** for greyhound and poodle
2. **Convert datasets to imagesets** for collie and cover
3. **Create question/option image folders** or remove those image references from the JSON
4. **Test the ImageProvider** - it should print warnings for missing assets

Would you like me to help you fix these issues? I can:
- Help you reorganize the existing assets to use the correct `.imageset` format
- Update the JSON to remove references to missing images
- Show you how to add the missing dog type assets
